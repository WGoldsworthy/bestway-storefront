# Offline/online states for Vue applications

This plugins notifies your application when online/offline status changes and allows to conditionally display components depending on the network status. Supports SSR.

# Installation

 ````
npm install vue-offline --save
````

There are two ways to use this plugin:

<b>Global</b> - if you register the plugin globally all features will be immediately avvailable in all of your components

````js
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueOffline from 'vue-offline'

Vue.use(VueOffline)
````
 <b>Local for specific components </b>- if you need online/offline features only in specific components you can inject them as a mixins. This approach could save a little bit of performance.

Add vue-offline mixin inside components that you want to have features listed below:
````js
import VueOfflineMixin from 'vue-offline/mixin'

export default {
  mixins: [VueOfflineMixin]
}

````
